🌟 About Me

I’m a motivated and professional software developper currently studying Software Development at Vanier College (2024–2025).
With a strong background in customer service, security operations, sales, and data collection, I bring teamwork and adaptability, analytical thinking, and continuous learning to every project I take on.

I enjoy solving problems, working in groups and collaborating on projects, building meaningful software, and expanding my technical skillset.
